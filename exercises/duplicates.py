# Given 2 collections of numbers of equal len find and delete the
# dublicates and return a collected collection.

# Use the folowing approach to solve the problem
# 1. Be sure you understand the question, ask for a clearification.
# 2. Think out loud, this is good at interviews and good at and exams!
# 3. Think it through before you start coding and tell about your thoughts
# 4. Code it, and again tell what you are doing.
# 4. Test it at the end, does it work
#	* think about the edge cases (empty collection, 1 in the collection)

# You should be able to think of 2-3 solutions for this problem. 
# Some nicer than others, some maybe faster than others.
# Try to code them all (2-3 solutions) and decide which one you like the most and why.
